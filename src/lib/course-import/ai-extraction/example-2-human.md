      <h2>What you’ll learn</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Construct a knowledge graph: Transform API specifications into a structured graph, then connect previously isolated APIs through business process data.</li>
        <li>Improve API discovery: Do semantic retrieval, and then use business process information from the knowledge graph to discover missing prerequisite APIs and their proper calling sequence.</li>
        <li>Build the agent: Create an agent that uses the knowledge graph to discover and execute APIs to carry out real tasks while following the correct process sequence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>About this course</h2>
      <p>Learn how to help AI agents find and execute the right APIs in the right order using a knowledge graph. Large companies may have thousands of APIs; this course brings API specifications into a knowledge graph and extends it with process data so an agent knows when, and in which order, each API should be called.</p>
      <p>In detail, you’ll:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand what knowledge graphs are and how they enable API discovery and execution.</li>
        <li>Construct your first knowledge graph from API services and endpoints and visualize it.</li>
        <li>Extend the graph with business-process data and dependencies.</li>
        <li>Perform semantic retrieval and add process edges to get required APIs and their order.</li>
        <li>Build an agent that uses the graph to discover and execute APIs in the right sequence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By the end of this course, you’ll have constructed a knowledge graph from API specifications and business process information and built an agent that can take business actions by discovering the right APIs and executing them in the right order.</p>

      <h2>Who should join?</h2>
      <p>This course is ideal for developers and AI builders working with large API ecosystems who need agents to choose the right services and calling order. Basic Python knowledge is required.</p>
