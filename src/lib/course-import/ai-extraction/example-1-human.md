      <h2>About this course</h2>
      <p>In this course, you’ll learn best practices for using Claude Code to improve your coding workflow. You’ll learn key tips on how to provide Claude Code with clear context, such as specifying the relevant files, clearly defining the features and functionality, and connecting Claude Code to MCP servers. You’ll apply these best practices to three examples: exploring a RAG chatbot codebase, analyzing ecommerce data in a Jupyter notebook, and creating a web app based on a Figma mockup.</p>
      <h3>In detail, using Claude Code, you’ll:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the underlying architecture of Claude Code and how it stores memory across sessions.</li>
        <li>Explore and understand the codebase of a RAG chatbot.</li>
        <li>Initiate a CLAUDE.md file with information about your codebase.</li>
        <li>Control context via escape, clear, and compact commands.</li>
        <li>Plan first, use thinking mode, and brainstorm with subagents.</li>
        <li>Write tests for chatbot functionality and refactor parts of the code.</li>
        <li>Use git worktrees to run multiple Claude sessions simultaneously.</li>
        <li>Fix GitHub issues and work with PRs using Claude Code’s integration.</li>
        <li>Execute code via hooks; refactor a Jupyter notebook into a dashboard.</li>
        <li>Use Figma and Playwright MCP servers to develop UI and improve designs.</li>
      </ul>
