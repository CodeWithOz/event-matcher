  "title": "Knowledge Graphs for AI Agent API Discovery",
  "description": "Learn how to help AI agents find and execute the right APIs in the right order using a knowledge graph. Large companies may have thousands of APIs; this course brings API specifications into a knowledge graph and extends it with process data so an agent knows when, and in which order, each API should be called.\n\nIn detail, you’ll:\nUnderstand what knowledge graphs are and how they enable API discovery and execution.\nConstruct your first knowledge graph from API services and endpoints and visualize it.\nExtend the graph with business-process data and dependencies.\nPerform semantic retrieval and add process edges to get required APIs and their order.\nBuild an agent that uses the graph to discover and execute APIs in the right sequence.\n\nBy the end of this course, you’ll have constructed a knowledge graph from API specifications and business process information and built an agent that can take business actions by discovering the right APIs and executing them in the right order.",
  "studentProfile": "This course is ideal for developers and AI builders working with large API ecosystems who need agents to choose the right services and calling order. Basic Python knowledge is required.",
  "learningGoals": [
    "Construct a knowledge graph: Transform API specifications into a structured graph, then connect previously isolated APIs through business process data.",
    "Improve API discovery: Do semantic retrieval, and then use business process information from the knowledge graph to discover missing prerequisite APIs and their proper calling sequence.",
    "Build the agent: Create an agent that uses the knowledge graph to discover and execute APIs to carry out real tasks while following the correct process sequence.",
