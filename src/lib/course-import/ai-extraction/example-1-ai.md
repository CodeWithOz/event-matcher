  "title": "Claude Code: A Highly Agentic Coding Assistant",
  "description": "In this course, you’ll learn best practices for using Claude Code to improve your coding workflow. You’ll learn key tips on how to provide Claude Code with clear context, such as specifying the relevant files, clearly defining the features and functionality, and connecting Claude Code to MCP servers. You’ll apply these best practices to three examples: exploring a RAG chatbot codebase, analyzing ecommerce data in a Jupyter notebook, and creating a web app based on a Figma mockup.\n\nIn detail, using Claude Code, you’ll:\nUnderstand the underlying architecture of Claude Code and how it stores memory across sessions.\nExplore and understand the codebase of a RAG chatbot.\nInitiate a CLAUDE.md file with information about your codebase.\nControl context via escape, clear, and compact commands.\nPlan first, use thinking mode, and brainstorm with subagents.\nWrite tests for chatbot functionality and refactor parts of the code.\nUse git worktrees to run multiple Claude sessions simultaneously.\nFix GitHub issues and work with PRs using Claude Code’s integration.\nExecute code via hooks; refactor a Jupyter notebook into a dashboard.\nUse Figma and Playwright MCP servers to develop UI and improve designs.",
  "studentProfile": "This course is ideal for anyone who wants to explore how AI coding assistant tools like Claude Code can enhance their development process. Whether you're building applications, debugging code, or exploring unfamiliar codebases, you’ll gain practical skills to work more efficiently with AI-assisted workflows. You can make the best of the course if you’re familiar with Python and Git.",
  "learningGoals": [
    "Use Claude code to explore, develop, test, refactor, and debug codebases.",
    "Extend the capabilities of Claude Code with MCP servers such as Playwright and Figma MCP servers.",
    "Apply Claude Code best practices to three projects: exploring and developing the codebase of a RAG chatbot, refactoring a Jupyter notebook for e-commerce data and transforming it into a dashboard, and building a web app from a Figma mockup."
